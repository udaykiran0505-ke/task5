Steps & Implementation
Data Preprocessing

Load and clean the dataset

Handle missing values and encode categorical features

Train Decision Tree Classifier

Visualize the decision tree using Graphviz or plot_tree

Tune parameters like max_depth to reduce overfitting

Train Random Forest Classifier

Compare accuracy with single decision tree

Perform feature importance analysis

Evaluation

Use cross-validation to assess model generalization

Compare models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

Overfitting Analysis

Train trees with various depths

Visualize accuracy trends for train/test splits

Results
